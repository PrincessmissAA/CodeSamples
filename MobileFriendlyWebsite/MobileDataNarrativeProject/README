In 2 - 3 sentences, please explain what data visualization you choose to edit and why?


I chose to do a mix of a lollipop, connected scatterplot, and area graph. This makes it easier to visually pick out the different data points. I’m also hoping to add in chart transition animations.

What modifications did you make to your data visualization? Please list all of them.


I wasn’t able to start making the graphs, I was looking for resources on how to stack the graphs, so that I had a better understanding of different graph styles to choose based on my understanding of it.
