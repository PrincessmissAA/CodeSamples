            My topic is on the anthropology series Precure, otherwise known as Pretty Cure. This series has been running for the past twenty-one years and has often been described as the love child between Sailor Moon and Super Sentai. This is a data analysis of its toy sales over the span of 18 years. The analysis was conducted to determine which season is the best, as Toei Animation declares the success of a season based on its toy sales. Cross-referencing this with Japan's GDP and Bandai Namco's total company sales provides deeper insights. The majority of my data came from Bandai Namco's financial reports and weekly financial reports broadcasted in Japan for stockholders.
